            We are two students who had to come up with a project for their capstone project and did not know what to do.
            Eventually we figured that we could take our interest for cars and helping others and merge them for our project.

        For a business to be successful, there needs to be a strong management standing behind
it. As technology is advancing, the tools made available to businesses have only increased with
the end goal of making the management more effective. In this capstone project we intend on
creating a tool that car dealerships can utilize to keep track of their inventory expenses in the
hopes that it will allow for these dealerships to have a way of visualizing how much they own a
vehicle for and its potential profit.
We intend on creating a website that will prompt the user to a login to which they can
access their vehicle inventory, after this they will have options to add vehicles, delete vehicles,
edit expenses, and view reports on whatever vehicle they desire. We were thinking that apart
from only being lists of vehicles we want to work on a way to have the vehicles be shown by
images of such a car, this will not only make the user interface more friendly but it will be a
more interactive way of getting to the desired vehicle.
